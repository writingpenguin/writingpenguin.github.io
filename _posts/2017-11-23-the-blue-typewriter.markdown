I frequent antique and thrift stores way too much. They are a great place to find used typewriters at a reasonable, most of the time, price. While the price is excellent, they might have minor cosmetic issues. They will almost always need a deep cleaning to return them to working condition.

I have a humble typewriter collection at only five typewriters. Each typewriter I have repaired and returned to perfect working condition. Most of them are older models from the 40s-60s. These machines are large, weigh a ton, and require a lot of force to depress a key. Due to both of these issues, I can’t write for a long time on any of my typewriters.

During one of my trips to a local antique store, I came across a beautiful blue brother typewriter from the 80s. It was compact, had light-weight keys, and was in a fantastic condition. It was my perfect machine. I had already spent forty dollars worth of toys, cameras, and a mason jar worth of old vacuum tubes, so I passed it up. I kick myself every day I type and my hands hurt after a few paragraphs.

The other day I had a feeling in my gut that it would be a great day to search for a typewriter. I spent most of the day, running to my usual places and searching for a lightweight daily use typewriter. The last stop, after almost giving up, I finally found one nestled away in the back of an antique store.

While it wasn’t the same Brother typewriter I had seen months ago, it was even better. It was a Royal typewriter that was small and compact, with very light keys. I purchased it as fast as I could swipe my credit card.

I plan on writing a detailed review after using the typewriter for a few weeks. After only a day of typing, I think this may be the best typewriter ever.
