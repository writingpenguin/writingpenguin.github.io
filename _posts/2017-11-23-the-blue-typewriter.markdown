I frequent antique and thrift stores way too much. They are a great place to find used typewriters at a reasonable price, **most of the time**. They might have minor cosmetic issues and will almost always need a deep cleaning. But with a little hard work, you can return these forgotten typewriters to their glory days.

With only five typewriters, I have quite a small collection. I have repaired and returned each machine to perfect working condition. Most of them are older models from the 40s-60s. Machines from this era usually weigh a ton and need a lot of force to depress a key. Due to these issues, I can’t write for a long time on any of my typewriters.

During one of my trips to an antique store a few months ago, I came across a beautiful Brother typewriter from the 80s. It was compact, had light-weight keys, and was painted in a fabulous blue color I had never seen before. It was my perfect machine. I had already spent forty dollars worth of toys, cameras, and a mason jar filled with old vacuum tubes, so I passed it up. I kick myself every day I type and my hands hurt after a few paragraphs.

The other day I had a feeling that I should go out searching for a new typewriter. I spent most of the day, running to my usual places and searching for a lightweight daily use typewriter. After almost giving up, I finally found one nestled away in the back of an antique store.

While it wasn’t the same Brother typewriter I had seen months ago, it was even better. It was a Royal typewriter that was small and compact, and most importantly had very light keys. I purchased it as fast as I could swipe my credit card.

I plan on writing a detailed review after using the typewriter for a few weeks. But, after only a day of typing, this may be the best typewriter ever.
