Moleskin is one of the most well known notebook manufactures in the world. Last year they made over 145.2 Million (EUR) in sales worldwide. While Moleskins are available everywhere, they are not always considered the best notebooks for fountain pen usage. Most Moleskins exhibit horrible bleeding and feathering when used with almost any fountain pen.

One day, while browsing my local Barnes and Noble I came across a new Moleskin notebook. For the first time I saw the paper weight printed on the notebook's packaging. The notebook touted 100 gsm weight paper. Since I liked the style of the notebook, something I will get to in a little bit, and wanted to see if Moleskins had improved, I purchased the notebook.

After filling the entire notebook after a month of usage, I finally think I’m ready to give my opinions on this new Moleskin product.

## Design

![Design](/assets/img/posts/Moleskin-Two-Go/DSC_8832.jpeg)

The Two-Go has many of the same features as most Moleskins. It has a nice elastic band to keep the notebook closed, ivory-colored pages, and a back pocket. The Two-Go measures in at 4.5x6.9 inches, which is a little smaller than Moleskin’s popular Medium sized notebook. I really love this form factor and wish more notebooks came in this size. Its perfect to carry around all day or stick in your back pocket.

What makes the Two-Go stand out is its cloth cover. The Two-Go is part of Moleskin’s “Textile Collection” notebooks. The notebook comes in Oriental Blue, Ash Grey, Raspberry Red, and Saxe Blue cloth colors. Some of the colors, such as the Raspberry Red, look really great in person. While others like the Saxe Blue seem kinda bland. The Two-Go I purchased was the Oriental Blue version. I don't like overly loud notebooks so I enjoyed the muted blue color.

I’m not a fan of the faux leather most notebooks have for their covers. I know faux leather is probably the best cover for notebooks since it can withstand a beating and not deteriorate. However, a cloth cover feels amazing to hold. Every time I picked up the Two-Go, I was excited to write in it. I wish more manufactures would offer cloth covering for their notebooks.

One of the odd things about this notebook is its twin bookmarks. Moleskin’s entire idea with this line of notebook is “Double” so it makes sense why they included two bookmarks. During my use, I never used the twin bookmarks to mark separate pages. I know these small pieces of cloth didn’t cost a lot, but the twin bookmarks seems odd and useless.

## Paper

Moleskin states the paper is 100 gsm, which is higher than their usual 70 gsm weight they have been using.

Right off the bat, this paper is much improved over previous Moleskins I’ve used.  As you would expect, the Two-Go works great with pencils, ballpoints, and rollerballs. More importantly, Two-Go also handles fountain pens pretty well. Although, this depends on your pen and ink combination.

I tested the notebook with a Twsbi Eco, filled with Pilot Ironshizuku Kon-Peki ink, and Sheffars R2-D2 fountain pen filled with their standard black ink cartridge. As you can see from the photos, the Two-Go worked great with the Twsbi and Pilot ink. There was almost no feathering and the ink dried quickly.

When using my Twsbi, the paper felt like it had just the right amount of tooth to it. I’m not a big fan of super smooth paper like Rhodia, so the Two-Go felt amazing to write on.

Unfortunately, the paper isn’t perfect. As you can see above, the Two-Go struggled with the Shaffer pen, showing a lot of feathering. Another big downsized is that only one side of each sheet contains lines for writing.

Moleskin sells this product as a way to "...track your ideas in parallel: freehand, unconfined and spontaneous on one side, considered, linear and precise on the other.” While this may work great for some, I wasn’t a big fan of the double paper styles. I mostly use my notebooks for writing, so I need as many lined pages as possible.

If you are someone who enjoys doodling while they write, this notebook would work great. I could see people using this notebook as a daily journal, with one page dedicated to writing and the other for small drawings of what happened in the day. If I was a little more drawing inclined, I might enjoy the double paper styles in the Two-Go.

## Price

As with most Moleskin products, the Two-Go is pretty expensive. It retails for around $20 (USD), which is $5 more than Moleskin’s popular Classic notebook.

While the overall design is amazing and the paper is an improvement over most Moleskin notebooks, the Two-Go still isn't worth its price. Unless you plan on following Moleskin’s belief that this notebook is meant to capture freeform ideas along with formal writing, the cost is too high for what you are getting.

Since I did not use the blank sides of the pages for drawing, I was able to fill the notebook up in about a month and a half. For $20, that isn’t much of a deal.

## Conclusion

![Overview](/assets/img/posts/Moleskin-Two-Go/DSC_8816.jpeg)

The Two-Go is a great step forward for Moleskin. The amazing cover, coupled with fountain pen friendly paper almost makes this notebook perfect. I loved using the Two-Go everyday I cracked it open to write in. Recently, Target was selling the Two-Go on sale for $10. I picked up a couple since at that lower price they are well worth it.

My biggest wish is that Moleskin would produce more notebooks like the Two-Go. It is unique and stands out on the shelf with the rest of the basic faux leather notebooks currently being sold.
