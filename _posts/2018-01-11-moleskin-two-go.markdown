Moleskin is one of the most well known notebook manufactures in the world. Last year alone they made over 145.2 Million (EUR) in sales worldwide. While Moleskins are available almost everywhere, they are not always considered the best notebooks for fountain pen usage. Most Moleskins exhibit horrible bleeding and feathering when you use almost any fountain pen.

One day, while browsing my local Barnes and Nobel I came across a new Moleskin notebook. For the first time ever on a Moleskin, I saw the paper weight printed on the packaging for the notebook. The notebook touted 100 gsm weight paper. Since I liked the style of the notebook, something I will get to in a little bit, and wanted to see if Moleskins did improve, I purchased the notebook.

After filling the entire notebook after a month of usage, I finally think I’m ready to give my opinions on this new Moleskin product.

## Design
![Design](/assets/img/posts/Moleskin-Two-Go/DSC_8832.jpeg)

The Two-Go has many of the same features as almost all of Moleskin’s other notebooks. It has a nice elastic band to keep the notebook close, ivory-colored pages, and a back pocket. The Two-Go measures in at 4.5x6.9 inches, which is a little smaller than Moleskin’s usual Medium sized notebook. However, I really loved this form factor and wished more notebooks would come in this size.

What makes the Two-Go stand out is its cloth cover. The Two-Go is part of Moleskin’s “Textile Collection” of medium sized notebooks. The notebook comes in Oriental Blue, Ash Grey, Raspberry Red, and Saxe Blue cloth colors. Some of the colors, such as the Raspberry Red, look really great in hand. While others like the Saxe Blue seem kinda bland. The Two-Go I purchased was the Oriental Blue version. Overall the color was pretty basic, I wasn’t searching for anything very loud.

I’m not a fan of the faux leather most notebooks have for their covers. I know faux leather is probably the best cover for notebooks since it can withstand a beating and not deteriorate. However, I can’t explain to you enough how amazing a cloth cover feels. Every time I picked up the Two-Go, I was excited to write in it. I really wish more manufactures would offer cloth covered notebooks, it really feels amazing in your hands.

One of the odd things about this notebook are its twin bookmarks. Moleskin’s entire idea with this line of notebook is “Double” so it makes sense why they included two bookmarks. In my use of the notebook, I never used the twin bookmarks to mark separate pages. I know those small pieces of cloth didn’t cost a lot, but the whole twin book marks just seemed odd and useless.

## Paper

This is the whole reason why I purchased this notebook. Moleskin states the paper is 100 gsm, which is higher than their usual 70 gsm weight they use.

Right off the bat, this paper is much improved over previous Moleskins I’ve used.  As you would expect, the Two-Go works great with pencils, ballpoints, and rollerballs. More importantly for me, Two-Go also handles fountain pens pretty well. Although, this depends on your pen and ink combination.

I tested the notebook with a Twsbi Eco, filled with [Iron Blue], and Sheffars R2-D2 fountain pen filled with their standard black ink. As you can see from the photos, the Two-Go worked great with the Twsbi and [Iron Blue] ink. There was almost no feathering and the ink dried really quickly.

When using my Twsbi, the paper felt like it had just the right amount of tooth to it. I’m not a big fan of super smooth paper, so the Two-Go felt amazing to write in.

Unfortunately, the paper isn’t perfect. As you can see above, the Two-Go struggled with the Shaffer pen, showing a lot of feathering. Another big downsized is that only one side of each sheet contains lines for writing.

Moleskin sells this product as a way to "...track your ideas in parallel: freehand, unconfined and spontaneous on one side, considered, linear and precise on the other.” While this may work great for some, I wasn’t a big fan of the double paper styles. I mostly use my notebooks for writing, so I would like as much lined paper as possible.

I will completely admit however, that for someone who enjoys doodling while they write, this notebook would work great for you. I could see people using this notebook as a daily journal, with one page dedicated to writing and the other for small drawings of what happened in the day. If I was a little more drawing inclined, I might enjoy the double paper styles in the Two-Go.

## Price

As with most Moleskin products, the Two-Go is pretty expensive when compared to comparable notebooks. It retails for around $20 (USD), which is around $5 more than Moleskin’s Classic notebook we all have seen everywhere.

While the overall design is amazing and the paper is a step up than most Moleskin notebooks, the Two-Go isn’t really for everyone. Unless you plan on following Moleskin’s belief that this notebook is meant to capture freeform ideas along with formal writing, the cost is too high for what you are getting.

Since I did not use the blank sides of the pages for drawing, I was able to fill the entire notebook in about a month and a half. For $20, that isn’t much of a deal.

## Conclusion
![Overview](/assets/img/posts/Moleskin-Two-Go/DSC_8816.jpeg)

The Two-Go is a great step forward for Moleskin. The amazing cover, coupled with fountain pen capable paper almost make this notebook perfect. I loved using the Two-Go everyday I cracked it open to write in.

My biggest wish is that Moleskin would produce more notebooks like the Two-Go. It is unique and stands out on the shelf with the rest of the notebooks currently being sold.
